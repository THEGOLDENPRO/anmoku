## Features âœ¨
- [ ] Fully type hinted. ðŸŒŒ ~~*yes you heard me*~~
- [ ] Rate limiting ðŸŽ€ (with actual waiting).
- [ ] Supports caching. âš¡

## It's eassssssy! ðŸ˜„
```python
import asyncio
from anmoku import AnimeCharacters

async def main():

    client = AsyncAnmoku(debug = True)

    anime_id = 28851 # ID for the anime film "A Silent Voice"

    anime_characters = await client.get(AnimeCharacters, anime_id)

    for character in anime_characters:
        print(f"{character.name} ({character.url})")

    await client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Output:
